# WebSiteAndAppProjects
This is a portfolio of the different things that I have done myself over the years that involve some aspects of web design and website creation.
Some noteable lessons these programs show:
- The prototypes of apps
- Intergration of JavaFX
- Use of drop down menues
- Slide shows of images with matching discriptions
- Interactive interfaces 
- Resizing sites for a mobile device
