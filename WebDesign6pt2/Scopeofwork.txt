proposed solutions:
Include a single navigational web page with navigation bar at the top that sends you to the desired spot which each link of the navigation bar. 
Either an about the company right at the top or an appealing picture. 
Followed by a small slide show of images and small bits of information for the images that move. 
After that I would suggest the real meat of the information be here columned up easier to digest parts. 
2 or 3 columns as to not make the columns run on and on. 
After that maybe external links to forms of social media. IE facebook twitter ect ect
